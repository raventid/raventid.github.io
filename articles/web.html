<h1>Interesting takes on web development</h1>

<p> I'm always impressed by how different programming language features could affect your style of writing web applications. There are a lot of languages you can write code for the web application: Java, Ruby, Elixir, Scala, Haskell and though they provide some interesting insights into application development, I'm more interested in less mainstream languages.</p>

<p> In this article we'll take a look at how to build a small database-backed web application in ATS, Idris and Ur. Each of them have very interesting language features I would love to show you and compare.</p>

<p>Our application would be a rather straightforward one, it's just a todo list with authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Some job stories</p>

  <li>When opening site for the first time, I want to see login page so I can access my dashboard. </li>
  <li>When item added to the dashboard, I want to see a feedback so I can avoid resubmitting the data. </li>
</ol>

  Let's quickly talk about my language list before jumping to code?
