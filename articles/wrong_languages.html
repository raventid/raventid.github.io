<h1>Wrong programming languages to learn</h1>

I've always been notoriously bad in selecting programming languages to learn. I've started with QBasic and Pascal a long time ago and I've tried about 60+ different programming languages. Here I'm gonna explain you why it might be a really bad hobby which leads to a lack of time and depression.

First, I want to say, if you are a programming language fan like me and you just cannot calmly seet when you know that some programming language you never tried exists - feel free to skip this article you know what I'm going to say.
