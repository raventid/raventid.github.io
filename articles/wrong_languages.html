<h1>Wrong programming languages to learn</h1>

<p>
I've always been notoriously bad in selecting programming languages to learn. I've started with QBasic and Pascal a long time ago and I've tried about 60+ different programming languages. Here I'm gonna explain you why it might be a really bad hobby which leads to a lack of time and depression.

First, I want to say, if you are a programming language fan like me and you just cannot calmly seet when you know that some programming language you never tried exists - feel free to skip this article you know what I'm going to say.
</p>

<p>
  First things first. It should be obvious that learning a new language requires some time. Time is your most valuable resource, clock is ticking and count the second till the end your life. Are your sure you want to spend your time doing useless work? I sure don't.

  There is a popular opinion - learning new languages will make you a better software developer. You will see a lot of different approaches to solve the same problem and gain some mistical insights into how to develop software. Learn Scala, Python, Clojure, Ruby, JavaScript, Kotlin, Rust and become enlighted one! Does it work this way? I doubt it.
  </p>

<p>
  When you programm in one programming language you learn ecosystem, you learn microtactics to solve particular problems and every day your brains forms intuitive patterns.

  Need to write test? You remeber your favourite framework API. Need to pass a dependency? You know how to do it in your language. Need to type new code and solve a typicall problem? Pass a logger, instantate class, use Fabric Method. You know what idioms your language use to increase performance, heck you know your language idioms - you've read a tons of articles about it.
  </p>

<p>
  Now, imagine your are starting to spend more time in a new programming language. For example let's imagine that you are Java developer and you learning Rust.

This is a totally fine code in Rust
<pre>
  fn check(r : Result<u8>) -> u8 {
    match r {
      Some(val) => val,
      None => 0
    }
  }
</pre>

By writing more and more code in this style you'll find it more and more comfortable. It would become your second nature. See some Enumeration? Create enum and create match when you need to work with an instance of this type.
Now, imagine that your are comming back to Java with this skills and habbits. What are you gonna do? The first thought is to just do the same thing!

class Result {
}

class Some extends Result {}
class None extends Result {}

fn check(Result r) {
  if r instanceof Some
  if r instanceof None
}
