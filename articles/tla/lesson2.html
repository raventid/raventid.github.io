        In the second lesson we will keep using our clock specification and I will try to demostrate you the philosophy behind TLA+ and the whole idea of temporal logic,
        but first. Let me introduce a logic. I will through some fancy words at you, so you can flex and show your skills to colleagues.

        I will explain what is Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory and how it is connected to mathematical foundation of what we will study here. Even if you are 0 in math, worry not, I will
        give you only high-level information. Enough for you to understand the subject and flex your knowledge, but not enough to claim you are mathematician.

        Let's make sure you remember what is boolean algebra. This is one of the foundational elements of TLA+ and without this we will not be able to move forward.

        Let's briefly walk through boolean algebra concept:

        Negation
        -A

        Conjunction
        A /\ B

        Disjunction
        A \/ B

        Equivalence
        A <=> B

        Implication
        A => B


        Let's try to play around boolean algebra in TLA+

        Go to the eval section in TLA+ toolbox and run this code TRUE /\ FALSE.

        Now, witness the power of TLA+. Let's build a truth tables for every expression. First, let's build a cartesian product from values. We need all pairs of
        TRUE and FALSE.

        <p>
        {TRUE, FALSE} \X {TRUE, FALSE}
        </p>

        Let's rewrite it in this way to make a binding called values. This is another way to construct a cartesian product, but this time we will add logical
        conjunction to every value. This way we can elegantly build a truth table for any operation.
        <p>
            LET values == {TRUE, FALSE}
            IN { <<a, b, a /\ b>> : a \in values, b \in values }
        </p>

        The same way you can build whole multiplication table for a school! Look:
        <p>
            LET values == {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
            IN { <<a, b, a * b>> : a \in values, b \in values }
        </p>

        Now, play around and make sure you understand those constructions. Build a truth table for NOT (-) operation and OR (\/) operation.

        As you might guess truth table for OR is the same as for AND, so you just have to change /\ sign to \/ sign.

        As for the NOT operator we have to simplify the code.
        <p>
            LET values == {TRUE, FALSE}
            IN { <<a, ~a>> : a \in values }
        </p>
    </body>
