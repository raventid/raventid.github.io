        This is my small tour on thinking about type systems, their connection to pure mathematics and do we need them in programming languages or not. (spoiler: I think we do)

        This article is inspired by Lamport, Dover article explaining the advantage of untyped set theory in comparison to type systems. I will quote this article a lot here as I am a big Leslie Lamport fanboy.
