        This is my small tour on thinking about type systems, their connection to pure mathematics and do we need them in programming languages or not. (spoiler: I think we do)

        This article is inspired by Lamport, Dover article explaining the advantage of untyped set theory in comparison to type systems. I will quote this article a lot here as I am a big Leslie Lamport fanboy.

        I will also metion some things I personally find interesting and reference some peculiarities of javascript design, a long discussion in ruby community, dependent type systems and their cost and so on.

        First - we need to define the framework of our discussion, is it philosophical discussion about types? Do we want to solve some problem with this discussion? Or is is just historical antology of type theory and type systems?

        I want to give you historical context for sure, but also a practical view of type systems in industrial programming, share my personal vision for types and how they affect the programming flow.

        Before we go with a history I want to start my narration with an example of software engineer trying to use type systems in a language like Java or Ruby:

        class A {
          public int field1;
          public string field2;
        }

        What you may here this person say is that they have a class A and inside two properties with types int and string.
        So A is a class, but field1 and field2 are fields with types. What is the type of A?
