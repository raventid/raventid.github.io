<h1>Provers. What are they and why you might need one?</h1>

In this article I would list some of proof assitants and theorem provers and will try to explain why someone might be interested in trying one of them.

<ul>
  <li>Coq</li>
  <li>Agda</li>
  <li>Idris</li>
  <li>ATS</li>
  <li>Arend</li>
  <li>Isabell</li>
  <li>LEAN</li>
  <li>F*</li>
</ul>


<div>
  <h3>Coq</h3>
  <p>Most widely used and established technology. Has a lot of great literature dedicated to it</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Agda</h3>
  <p>Popular prover developed after Haskell with lazyness in mind. Also has a great tutorial and you would find this usefull if you already have some Haskell knowledge</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Idris</h3>
  <p>First language which is trying to find a practical application of dependent types. Could be used as a prover, but more a practical language with dependent types</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>ATS</h3>
  <p>Most esoteric language among all of the contenders. Contains proof-language, language with dependent types and refinement types and many more tricks for low-level programming. You can write type-safe malloc and free with it and do type-safe pointer arithmetic. We'll take a closer look at ATS later in other articles too.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Arend</h3>
  <p>Prover developed by JetBrains research. Based on HOTT approach and gives you a few intereting tricks you can use + perfect IDE to work in</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Isabell</h3>
  <p>Very practical prover. Not hyped, but people just silently do the real stuff with it. (Here gonna be the link)</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>LEAN</h3>
  <p>Prover developed by Microsoft Research as a response to Coq quirks. Has a very nice intro tutorial and VS Code plugin.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>F*</h3>
  <p>One more contender by Microsoft Research. We want stop here, but F* has been used to verify real software not so long time ago (link to network stack)</p>
</div>
