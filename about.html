<h1>About me</h1>


    <p>
    I am software developer. I've been writing programs for more than 6 years and built CRM/ERP systems, web-sites (frontend and backend), controllers for embed devices, and application backends under heavy load (web scale :smile:).
    </p>

    <p>
    I've used Javascript, Php, Java, C, Ruby, Rust, Elixir at work and many more for my personal projects. I'm interested in formal methods, functional programming languages (Elixir and Haskell are my favourites now), operating systems, programming language design and web-backends.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many times I've tried to become C# developer, I had Windows computer and programmed hobby projects in C#, later I've installed Mono on my Linux, later on my Mac. I played with F#. But I have never found an opportunity to write C# or F# for production. Though, I really liked language, libraries and documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most fresh production experience I have is web-backend with <b>Ruby</b> (large app for selling airline tickets), <b>Rust</b> (search engine for airline airline tickets) and <b>Elixir</b> (small self contained web-backends).
    </p>

    <p>
        I might also get you covered with mobile applications written in Swift and Kotlin. Frontend (ReasonML, Javascript) with React.
        "DevSecOps" with AWS and/or Kubernetes. My skills are pretty mediocre here, but I can do some plumbing.
    </p>

        It is really tough to describe someone. Every human is a very complex and unique creature, but I'll try to give you a brief self-overview from professinal perspective and perhaps a bit personal.
        </p>
    <p>
        When I was child I've been dreaming to become a writer. When I was 8 I wrote a book (really about 20 pages) about monsters (I've been impressed by R. Stains tells). I really never had a crystally clear vision of my life, I worked here and there before I discover programming. This moment I felt this is one of the things which I might like. I remebered some basic programming ideas from school where I've been trained procedural programming, beautiful QBasic and Borland Pascal environments.

        As you can see my passion for writing did not dissapear. Let's jump to a modern time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I started to program in Php, later I've used Javascript to build frontends, later I had a chance to work with Java and C, later I switched to Ruby, dissapointed by the language I got back to Javascript and used Node.js to develop fullstack, after a few months of Node.js I've decided to get back to Ruby, I spent few months in Ruby again and still had a feeling that it's not my piece of cake, so I switched to Rust and after a few month got to Ruby back again with my transformed vision of what I can do with programming languages.

    This is a stub site. Which I'm planning to transform into my personal programming blog.

    <div> Things I like about programming </div>

    <p>Programming languages</p>

    <p>I'm interested in compiler construction. All steps from parsing to code generation. Also I'm interested in studing different approaches to expressing solution to the same problem</p>

    Languages I like to look at from compiler perspective are:

    Erlang - actor-based programming
    Ruby - open classes, metaprogramming, interesting JIT approach, very nice and basic virtual machine.
    Rust - example of LLVM usage, interesting compiler
    GHC - interesting compiler
    ATS - interestign mixture of precise control over memory aspects of your programm and in the same time ability to write high-level proofs
    C - lingua franca (still usefull language to read Ruby, GHC and many other code bases)

    <p>Formal verification. Model checking.</p>

    <p>I'm also interested in building correct systems, here I'm studying technologies which allow to bring more quality into software systems</p>

    <p>Coq, Lean, TLA+, Isabell</p>
