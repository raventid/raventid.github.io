                    Hi, my dear friend.
                    I am raventid.
                    I call myself an artist, as I persive life and living as a form of art.

                <p>
                    This website looks weird because I've decided to autogenerate it with my own static site generator
                    which is a work in progress,
                    I also kinda write this static site generator in a research programming language, which complicates everything.
                    Hopefully I will improve this very soon (but most probably not).
                </p>
