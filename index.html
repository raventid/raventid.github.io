    Hi, my dear friend. I am raventid.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am software developer. I've been writing programs for more than 5 year and built CRM/ERP systems, web-sites (frontend and backend), controllers for embed devices, and application backends under heavy load (web scale :smile:).
    </p>

    <p>
    I've used Javascript, Php, Java, C, Ruby, Rust, Elixir at work and many more for my personal projects. I'm interested in formal methods, functional programming languages (Elixir and Haskell are my favourites now), operating systems, programming language design and web-backends.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many times I've tried to become C# developer, I had Windows computer and programmed hobby projects in C#, later I've installed Mono on my Linux, later on my Mac. I played with F#. But I have never found an opportunity to write C# or F# for production. Though, I really liked language, libraries and documentation.

    <p>
        Most fresh production experience I have is web-backend with <b>Ruby</b> (large app for selling airline tickets), <b>Rust</b> (search engine airline tickets) and <b>Elixir</b> (small self contained web-backends).

        It is really tough to describe someone. Every human is a very complex and unique creature, but I'll try to give you a brief self-overview from professinal perspective and perhaps a bit personal.

        When I was child I've been dreaming to become a writer. When I was 8 I wrote a book (really about 20 pages) about monsters (I've been impressed by R. Stains tells). I really never had a crystally clear vision of my life, I worked here and there before I discover programming. This moment I felt this is one of the things which I might like.

        As you can see my passion for writing did not dissapear

    This is a stub site. Which I'm planning to transform into my personal programming blog.
