                    Hi, my dear friend.

                    This website looks weird because I've decided to autogenerate it with my own static site generator
                    which is a work in progress,
                    I also kinda write this static site generator in a research programming language (<a href="https://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/atslangweb/">ATS</a>a), which complicates everything.
                    Hopefully I will improve this very soon (hahahaha, sure).

                Though it looks like younger generation does not perceive M$ as something bad anymore. I miss those times of childish wars "what programming language is the best?", "we will destory your company with our hacking!!!"
