    Hi, my dear friend. I am raventid.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am software developer. I've been writing programs for more than 5 year and built CRM/ERP systems, web-sites (frontend and backend), controllers for embed devices, and highload application backends.
    </p>

    <p>
    I've used Javascript, Php, Java, C, Ruby, Rust, Elixir at work and many more for my personal projects. I'm interested in formal methods, functional programming languages (Elixir and Haskell are my favourites now), operating systems, programming language design and web-backends.

    <p>
    This is a stub site. Which I'm planning to transform into my personal programming blog.
